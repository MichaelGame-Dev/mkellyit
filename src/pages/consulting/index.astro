      <h1>Consulting Services</h1>

      <h2>Principles</h2>
      <p>My consulting principles are pretty simple. </p>
      <ol>
          <li>My end goal is to provide you value </li>
          <p>This is the key for me, if I can't provide you value or can't do your project,
              I don't want to waste your time or money. After an initial discussion about your project,
          if I can't do it, I'll tell you. If there's particular challenges I see, I'll tell you.</p>

          <li>I'm not a "Yes Man"</li>
          <p>Ultimately, the project is yours as is the final decision, but I may challenge you
          on specifics. I'm going to ask you 'why?' to fully understand the requirements.
          If I see a better approach, I'm going to suggest it and tell you why I think this other approach might be a better option.
          </p>
          <li>Aim for simplicty</li>
          <p>To me, if you can get by with a simple, straightforward approach, it's likely the right one. There are definitely times to add abstraction/complexity if it's certain you'll need it.
              But planning for every "What if?" has some major disadvantages. You end up with:
              
              <ul>
                  <li>A more complex solution</li>
                  <li>Longer development/project time, meaning higher project cost</li>
              </ul>
              Just to name a few. One response might be "Well we need this to do X next year so we need this complexity."
              But what if you change your mind by next year? There could be a lot of time and money spent on extra code
              and testing that is never fully utilized.,
          </p>
      </ol>
